is a proof-of-concept library for working with Spark using more expressive types.\nIt consists of the following modules:\n\ndataset for more strongly typed Datasets  (supports Spark 2.0.x)\ncats for using Spark with cats (supports Cats 0.7.x)\n\nThe Frameless project and contributors support the\nTypelevel Code of Conduct and want all its\nassociated channels (e.g. GitHub, Gitter) to be a safe and friendly environment for contributing and learning.\nDocumentation\n\nTypedDataset: Feature Overview\nComparing TypedDatasets with Spark's Datasets\nTyped Encoders in Frameless\nInjection: Creating Custom Encoders\nUsing Cats with RDDs\nProof of Concept: TypedDataFrame\n\nWhy?\nBenefits of using TypedDataset compared to vanilla Dataset:\n\nTypesafe columns referencing and expressions\nCustomizable, typesafe encoders\nTypesafe casting and projections\nEnhanced type signature for some built-in functions\n\nQuick Start\nFrameless is compiled against Scala 2.11.x.\nNote that while Frameless is still getting off the ground, it is very possible that breaking changes will be\nmade for at least the next few versions.\nTo use Frameless in your project add the following in your build.sbt file as needed:\nresolvers += Resolver.sonatypeRepo(\"releases\")\n\nval framelessVersion = \"0.2.0\"\n\nlibraryDependencies ++= List(\n  \"io.github.adelbertc\" %% \"frameless-cats\"      % framelessVersion,\n  \"io.github.adelbertc\" %% \"frameless-dataset\"   % framelessVersion\n)\n\nAn easy way to bootstrap a Frameless sbt project:\n\nif you have Giter8 installed then simply:\n\ng8 imarios/frameless.g8\n\n\nwith sbt >= 0.13.13:\n\nsbt new imarios/frameless.g8\n\nTyping sbt console inside your project will bring up a shell with Frameless\nand all its dependencies loaded (including Spark). \nDevelopment\nWe require at least one sign-off (thumbs-up, +1, or similar) to merge pull requests. The current maintainers\n(people who can merge pull requests) are:\n\nadelbertc\njeremyrsmith\nkanterov\nnon\nOlivierBlanvillain\n\nLicense\nCode is provided under the Apache 2.0 license available at http://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0,\nas well as in the LICENSE file. This is the same license used as Spark.\n"},"GettingStarted.html":{"url":"GettingStarted.html","title":"TypedDataset: Feature Overview","keywords":"","body":"TypedDataset: Feature Overview\nThis tutorial introduces TypedDatasets through a small toy example.\nThe following imports are needed to make all code examples compile.\nimport org.apache.spark.{SparkConf, SparkContext}\nimport org.apache.spark.sql.SparkSession\nimport frameless.functions.aggregate._\nimport frameless.TypedDataset\n\nval conf = new SparkConf().setMaster(\"local[*]\").setAppName(\"frameless repl\").set(\"spark.ui.enabled\", \"false\")\nval spark = SparkSession.builder().config(conf).appName(\"REPL\").getOrCreate()\nimplicit val sqlContext = spark.sqlContext\nspark.sparkContext.setLogLevel(\"WARN\")\n\nimport spark.implicits._\n\nCreating TypedDataset instances\nWe start by defining a simple case class that will be the basis of our examples.\ncase class Apartment(city: String, surface: Int, price: Double)\n\nAnd let's define a few Apartment instances:\nval apartments = Seq(\n  Apartment(\"Paris\", 50, 300000.0),\n  Apartment(\"Paris\", 100, 450000.0),\n  Apartment(\"Paris\", 25, 250000.0),\n  Apartment(\"Lyon\", 83, 200000.0),\n  Apartment(\"Lyon\", 45, 133000.0),\n  Apartment(\"Nice\", 74, 325000.0)\n)\n\nWe are now ready to instantiate a TypedDataset[Apartment]:\nval apartmentsTypedDS = TypedDataset.create(apartments)\n// apartmentsTypedDS: frameless.TypedDataset[Apartment] = [city: string, surface: int ... 1 more field]\n\nWe can also create it from an existing Dataset:\nval apartmentsDS = spark.createDataset(apartments)\n// apartmentsDS: org.apache.spark.sql.Dataset[Apartment] = [city: string, surface: int ... 1 more field]\n\nval apartmentsTypedDS = TypedDataset.create(apartmentsDS)\n// apartmentsTypedDS: frameless.TypedDataset[Apartment] = [city: string, surface: int ... 1 more field]\n\nOr use the frameless syntax:\nimport frameless.syntax._\n// import frameless.syntax._\n\nval apartmentsTypedDS2 = spark.createDataset(apartments).typed\n// apartmentsTypedDS2: frameless.TypedDataset[Apartment] = [city: string, surface: int ... 1 more field]\n\nTypesafe column referencing\nThis is how we select a particular column from a TypedDataset:\nval cities: TypedDataset[String] = apartmentsTypedDS.select(apartmentsTypedDS('city))\n// cities: frameless.TypedDataset[String] = [_1: string]\n\nThis is completely safe, for instance suppose we misspell city:\napartmentsTypedDS.select(apartmentsTypedDS('citi))\n// :33: error: No column Symbol with shapeless.tag.Tagged[String(\"citi\")] of type A in Apartment\n//        apartmentsTypedDS.select(apartmentsTypedDS('citi))\n//                                                  ^\n\nThis gets caught at compile-time, whereas with traditional Spark Dataset the error appears at run-time.\napartmentsDS.select('citi)\n// org.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException: cannot resolve '`citi`' given input columns: [city, surface, price];;\n// 'Project ['citi]\n// +- LocalRelation

However, if we make a mistake in\nany of the names and/or their types, then we get a compilation error.\nSay we make a typo in a field name:\ncase class PriceInfo2(ratio: Double, pricEE: Double)\n\naptWithRatio.project[PriceInfo2]\n// :45: error: Cannot prove that ApartmentDetails can be projected to PriceInfo2. Perhaps not all member names and types of PriceInfo2 are the same in ApartmentDetails?\n//        aptWithRatio.project[PriceInfo2]\n//                            ^\n\nSay we make a mistake in the corresponding type:\ncase class PriceInfo3(ratio: Int, price: Double) // ratio should be Double\n\naptWithRatio.project[PriceInfo3]\n// :45: error: Cannot prove that ApartmentDetails can be projected to PriceInfo3.

with Spark's Datasets","keywords":"","body":"Comparing TypedDatasets with Spark's Datasets\nGoal:\n  This tutorial compares the standard Spark Datasets api with the one provided by\n  frameless' TypedDataset. It shows how TypedDatsets allows for an expressive and\n  type-safe api with no compromises on performance.\nFor this tutorial we first create a simple dataset and save it on disk as a parquet file.\nParquet is a popular columnar format and well supported by Spark.\nIt's important to note that when operating on parquet datasets, Spark knows that each column is stored\nseparately, so if we only need a subset of the columns Spark will optimize for this and avoid reading\nthe entire dataset. This is a rather simplistic view of how Spark and parquet work together but it\nwill serve us well for the context of this discussion.\nimport spark.implicits._\n// import spark.implicits._\n\n// Our example case class Foo acting here as a schema\ncase class Foo(i: Long, j: String)\n// defined class Foo\n\n// Assuming spark is loaded and SparkSession is bind to spark\nval initialDs = spark.createDataset( Foo(1, \"Q\") :: Foo(10, \"W\") :: Foo(100, \"E\") :: Nil )\n// initialDs: org.apache.spark.sql.Dataset[Foo] = [i: bigint, j: string]\n\n// Assuming you are on Linux or Mac OS\ninitialDs.write.parquet(\"/tmp/foo\")\n\nval ds = spark.read.parquet(\"/tmp/foo\").as[Foo]\n// ds: org.apache.spark.sql.Dataset[Foo] = [i: bigint, j: string]\n\nds.show()\n// +---+---+\n// |  i|  j|\n// +---+---+\n// | 10|  W|\n// |  1|  Q|\n// |100|  E|\n// +---+---+\n//\n\nThe value ds holds the content of the initialDs read from a parquet file.\nLet's try to only use field i from Foo and see how Spark's Catalyst (the query optimizer)\noptimizes this.\n// Using a standard Spark TypedColumn in select()\nval filteredDs = ds.filter($\"i\" === 10).select($\"i\".as[Long])\n// filteredDs: org.apache.spark.sql.Dataset[Long] = [i: bigint]\n\nfilteredDs.show()\n// +---+\n// |  i|\n// +---+\n// | 10|\n// +---+\n//\n\nThe filteredDs is of type Dataset[Long]. Since we only access field i from Foo the type is correct.\nUnfortunately, this syntax requires handholding by explicitly setting the TypedColumn in the select statement\nto return type Long (look at the as[Long] statement). We will discuss this limitation next in more detail.\nNow, let's take a quick look at the optimized Physical Plan that Spark's Catalyst generated.\nfilteredDs.explain()\n// == Physical Plan ==\n// *Project [i#566L]\n// +- *Filter (isnotnull(i#566L) && (i#566L = 10))\n//    +- *BatchedScan parquet [i#566L] Format: ParquetFormat, InputPaths: file:/tmp/foo, PartitionFilters: [], PushedFilters: [IsNotNull(i), EqualTo(i,10)], ReadSchema: struct\n\nThe last line is very important (see ReadSchema). The schema read\nfrom the parquet file only required reading column i without needing to access column j.\nThis is great! We have both an optimized query plan and type-safety!\nUnfortunately, this syntax is not bulletproof: it fails at run-time if we try to access\na non existing column x:\nscala> ds.filter($\"i\" === 10).select($\"x\".as[Long])\norg.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException: cannot resolve '`x`' given input columns: [i, j];;\n'Project ['x]\n+- Filter (i#566L = cast(10 as bigint))\n   +- Relation[i#566L,j#567] parquet\n\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.analysis.package$AnalysisErrorAt.failAnalysis(package.scala:42)\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.analysis.CheckAnalysis$$anonfun$checkAnalysis$1$$anonfun$apply$2.applyOrElse(CheckAnalysis.scala:77)\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.analysis.CheckAnalysis$$anonfun$checkAnalysis$1$$anonfun$apply$2.applyOrElse(CheckAnalysis.scala:74)\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.trees.TreeNode$$anonfun$transformUp$1.apply(TreeNode.scala:308)\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.trees.TreeNode$$anonfun$transformUp$1.apply(TreeNode.scala:308)\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.trees.CurrentOrigin$.withOrigin(TreeNode.scala:69)\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.trees.TreeNode.transformUp(TreeNode.scala:307)\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.plans.QueryPlan.transformExpressionUp$1(QueryPlan.scala:269)\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.plans.QueryPlan.org$apache$spark$sql$catalyst$plans$QueryPlan$$recursiveTransform$2(QueryPlan.scala:279)\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.plans.QueryPlan$$anonfun$org$apache$spark$sql$catalyst$plans$QueryPlan$$recursiveTransform$2$1.apply(QueryPlan.scala:283)\n  at scala.collection.TraversableLike$$anonfun$map$1.apply(TraversableLike.scala:234)\n  at scala.collection.TraversableLike$$anonfun$map$1.apply(TraversableLike.scala:234)\n  at scala.collection.immutable.List.foreach(List.scala:381)\n  at scala.collection.TraversableLike$class.map(TraversableLike.scala:234)\n  at scala.collection.immutable.List.map(List.scala:285)\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.plans.QueryPlan.org$apache$spark$sql$catalyst$plans$QueryPlan$$recursiveTransform$2(QueryPlan.scala:283)\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.plans.QueryPlan$$anonfun$8.apply(QueryPlan.scala:288)\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.trees.TreeNode.mapProductIterator(TreeNode.scala:186)\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.plans.QueryPlan.transformExpressionsUp(QueryPlan.scala:288)\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.analysis.CheckAnalysis$$anonfun$checkAnalysis$1.apply(CheckAnalysis.scala:74)\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.analysis.CheckAnalysis$$anonfun$checkAnalysis$1.apply(CheckAnalysis.scala:67)\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.trees.TreeNode.foreachUp(TreeNode.scala:126)\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.analysis.CheckAnalysis$class.checkAnalysis(CheckAnalysis.scala:67)\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.analysis.Analyzer.checkAnalysis(Analyzer.scala:58)\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.execution.QueryExecution.assertAnalyzed(QueryExecution.scala:49)\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.Dataset.(Dataset.scala:161)\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.Dataset.(Dataset.scala:167)\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.Dataset.select(Dataset.scala:1023)\n  ... 450 elided\n\nThere are two things to improve here. First, we would want to avoid the at[Long] casting that we are required\nto type for type-safety. This is clearly an area where we can introduce a bug by casting to an incompatible\ntype. Second, we want a solution where reference to a\nnon existing column name fails at compilation time.\nThe standard Spark Dataset can achieve this using the following syntax.\nds.filter(_.i == 10).map(_.i).show()\n// +-----+\n// |value|\n// +-----+\n// |   10|\n// +-----+\n//\n\nThis looks great! It reminds us the familiar syntax from Scala.\nThe two closures in filter and map are functions that operate on Foo and the\ncompiler will helps us capture all the mistakes we mentioned above.\nscala> ds.filter(_.i == 10).map(_.x).show()\n:23: error: value x is not a member of Foo\n       ds.filter(_.i == 10).map(_.x).show()\n                                  ^\n\nUnfortunately, this syntax does not allow Spark to optimize the code.\nds.filter(_.i == 10).map(_.i).explain()\n// == Physical Plan ==\n// *SerializeFromObject [input[0, bigint, true] AS value#602L]\n// +- *MapElements , obj#601: bigint\n//    +- *DeserializeToObject newInstance(class $line14.$read$$iw$$iw$$iw$$iw$Foo), obj#600: $line14.$read$$iw$$iw$$iw$$iw$Foo\n//       +- *Filter .apply\n//          +- *BatchedScan parquet [i#566L,j#567] Format: ParquetFormat, InputPaths: file:/tmp/foo, PartitionFilters: [], PushedFilters: [], ReadSchema: struct\n\nAs we see from the explained Physical Plan, Spark was not able to optimize our query as before.\nReading the parquet file will required loading all the fields of Foo. This might be ok for\nsmall datasets or for datasets with few columns, but will be extremely slow for most practical\napplications.\nIntuitively, Spark currently doesn't have a way to look inside the code we pass in these two\nclosures.

TypeEncoders are passed around as implicit parameters to every frameless method to ensure that the data being manipulated is Encoder. It uses a standard implicit resolution coupled with shapeless type class derivation mechanism to ensure every that compiling code manipulates encodable data. For example, the code java.util.Date example won't compile with frameless:\nscala> import frameless.TypedDataset\nimport frameless.TypedDataset\n\nscala> val ds: TypedDataset[DateRange] = TypedDataset.create(Seq(DateRange(new java.util.Date, new java.util.Date)))\n:27: error: could not find implicit value for parameter encoder: frameless.TypedEncoder[DateRange]\n       val ds: TypedDataset[DateRange] = TypedDataset.create(Seq(DateRange(new java.util.Date, new java.util.Date)))\n                                                            ^\n\nType class derivation takes case or recursively constructing (and proving the existence) TypeEncoders for case classes.

With the introduction of Dataset in Spark 1.6, DataFrame seems deprecated and won't be the focus of future developments of frameless. However, the design is interesting enough for being documented.\nTo safely manipulate DataFrames we use a technique called shadow type, which consists in storing additional information about a value in a \"dummy\" type. Mirroring value-level computation at the type-level lets us leverage the type system to catch common mistakes at compile time.\nDiving in\nIn TypedDataFrame, we use a single Schema  to model the number, the types and the names of columns. Here is a what the definition of TypedDataFrame looks like, with simplified type signatures:\nimport org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame\nimport shapeless.HList\n\nclass TDataFrame[Schema  Boolean): TDataFrame[Schema] = ???\n\n  def select[C \nAs you can see, instead of the def filter(conditionExpr: String): DataFrame defined in Spark, the TypedDataFrame version expects a function from Schema to Boolean, and models the fact that resulting DataFrame will still hold elements of type Schema.\nType-level column referencing\nFor Spark's DataFrames, column referencing is done directly by Strings or using the Column type which provides no additional type safety. TypedDataFrame improves on that by catching column referencing at compile type. When everything goes well, frameless select is very similar to vanilla select, except that it keeps track of the selected column types:\nimport frameless.TypedDataFrame\n\ncase class Foo(s: String, d: Double, i: Int)\n\ndef selectIntString(tf: TypedDataFrame[Foo]): TypedDataFrame[(Int, String)] =\n  tf.select('i, 's)\n\nHowever, in case of typo, it gets coughs right away:\ndef selectIntStringTypo(tf: TypedDataFrame[Foo]): TypedDataFrame[(Int, String)] =\n  tf.select('j, 's)\n\nType-level joins\nJoins can available with two different syntaxes, the first lets you reference different columns on each TypedDataFrame, and ensures that their all exists and have compatible types:\ncase class Bar(i: Int, j: String, b: Boolean)\n\ndef join1(tf1: TypedDataFrame[Foo], tf2: TypedDataFrame[Bar])\n    : TypedDataFrame[(String, Double, Int, Int, String, Boolean)] =\n  tf1.innerJoin(tf2).on('s).and('j)\n\nThe second syntax bring some convenience when the joining columns have identical names in both tables:\ndef join2(tf1: TypedDataFrame[Foo], tf2: TypedDataFrame[Bar])\n    : TypedDataFrame[(String, Double, Int, String, Boolean)] =\n  tf1.innerJoin(tf2).using('i)\n\nFurther example are available in the TypedDataFrame join tests.\nComplete example\nWe now consider a complete example to see how the type system can frameless can improve not only correctness but also the readability of Spark jobs. Consider the following domain of phonebooks, city map and neighborhood:\ntype Neighborhood = String\ntype Address = String\n\ncase class PhoneBookEntry(\n  address: Address,\n  residents: String,\n  phoneNumber: Double\n)\n\ncase class CityMapEntry(\n  address: Address,\n  neighborhood: Neighborhood\n)\n\nOur goal will be to compute the neighborhood with unique names, approximating \"unique\" with names containing less common\nletters in the alphabet: 'x', 'q', and 'z'. We are going to need a natural language processing library at some point, so\nlet's use the following for the example:\nobject NLPLib {\n  def uniqueName(name: String): Boolean = name.exists(Set('x', 'q', 'z'))\n}\n\nSuppose we manage to obtain a TypedDataFrame[PhoneBookEntry] and a TypedDataFrame[CityMapEntry] public data, here is what our Spark job could look like with frameless:\nimport org.apache.spark.sql.SQLContext\n\n// These case classes are used to hold intermediate results\ncase class Family(residents: String, neighborhood: Neighborhood)\ncase class Person(name: String, neighborhood: Neighborhood)\ncase class NeighborhoodCount(neighborhood: Neighborhood, count: Long)\n\ndef bestNeighborhood\n  (phoneBookTF: TypedDataFrame[PhoneBookEntry], cityMapTF: TypedDataFrame[CityMapEntry])\n  (implicit c: SQLContext): String = {\n                                          (((((((((\n  phoneBookTF\n    .innerJoin(cityMapTF).using('address) :TypedDataFrame[(Address, String, Double, String)])\n    .select('_2, '_4)                     :TypedDataFrame[(String, String)])\n    .as[Family]()                         :TypedDataFrame[Family])\n    .flatMap { f =>\n      f.residents.split(' ').map(r => Person(r, f.neighborhood))\n    }                                     :TypedDataFrame[Person])\n    .filter { p =>\n      NLPLib.uniqueName(p.name)\n    }                                     :TypedDataFrame[Person])\n    .groupBy('neighborhood).count()       :TypedDataFrame[(String, Long)])\n    .as[NeighborhoodCount]()              :TypedDataFrame[NeighborhoodCount])\n    .sortDesc('count)                     :TypedDataFrame[NeighborhoodCount])\n    .select('neighborhood)                :TypedDataFrame[Tuple1[String]])\n    .head._1\n}\n\nIf you compare this version from Spark vanilla where every line is a DataFrame, you see how much types can improve readability. An executable version of this example is available in the BestNeighborhood test.\nLimitations\nThe main limitation of this approach comes from Scala 2.10, which limits the arity of class classes to 22. Because of the way DataFrame models joins, joining two table with more that 11 fields results in a DataFrame which not representable with Schema of type Product.\nIn the Dataset API introduced in Spark 1.6, the way join are handled was rethought to return a pair of both schemas instead of a flat table, which moderates the trouble caused by case class limitations. Alternatively, since Scala 2.11, it is possible to define Tuple23 and onward. Sadly, due to the way Spark is commonly packaged in various systems, the amount Spark users having to Scala 2.11 and not to Spark 1.6 is essentially zero. For this reasons, further development in frameless will target Spark 1.6+, deprecating the early work onTypedDataFrame.\n"}}}
